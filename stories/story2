She looked up. She was greeted with the sight of teeth, saliva dripping from each and every one of them, and also a bit too close for her liking. The teeth seemed as if they were meticulously-shaped to look like a knife, inches away from cutting her. 
Making her bleed. 
To death.
She could feel her heart ricocheting against her ribcage. Her heart was beating so fast and so intensely, she could have sworn that the monster heard it.
She tried desperately to fight the feeling of fear creeping up her spine as she step back slowly, almost unnoticeably. 
Or not.
"Don't move ANOTHER STEP!" the monster yelled. Its voice was like thunder. She could feel the earth trembling under her feet.
She cowered in fear, instincts taking over as she curled into a small ball before the monster, her body spasmed violently, not being able to hide her silent sobs.
She felt it. Her impending death. 
And it ended as soon as it started.
Nothingness.
